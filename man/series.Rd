\describe{
\item{m}{The number of days in the observation period (3652 for a 10-year period including leap years).}
\item{columns}{Each column represents daily precipitation (in mm) recorded at one of the 20 rain gauges.}

\description{
This dataset contains daily accumulated precipitation (in mm) over a 10-year period, from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2022. The data were collected from 20 rain gauges located in the states of Maranhão and Piauí, Brazil. Each column represents the precipitation recorded at one rain gauge, and each row corresponds to a specific day in the observation period.
}
\details{
The data were collected using rain gauges installed at national meteorological stations managed by the National Institute of Meteorology (INMET) and the National Water and Basic Sanitation Agency (ANA). The study area covers parts of Maranhão and Piauí, located in northeastern Brazil, a region known for its diverse climatic and geographic conditions. The dataset provides valuable insights for climate and hydrology studies in this region.
